RAG Assessment Skeleton
----------------------
This is a technical interview assessment for a Solutions Engineer role at Glean.

Your task: Complete the functions and logic below to build a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demo.

Requirements:
- Read and chunk markdown files from the 'faqs/' directory.
- Embed the chunks using OpenAI's embedding API.
- Retrieve the top-k most relevant chunks for a user query.
- Generate an answer using OpenAI's chat completion API, citing at least two source files.
- Output the answer and sources as a JSON object to stdout.
